Bio-Key,Design Thinking,- Autumn 2017,"In my Design Thinking class, we had to create a working prototype that solves a disaster of our choice. My group of 3 chose cyber security as it affects millions of people worldwide. We focused on healthcare as those records are extremely private and sensitive. Our final product was used to authenticate and authorize healthcare professionals and making sure all the information they access is protected. We performed a series of milestones, creating character profiles, user testing, interviews while focusing on improving security and increasing convenience during the login process. Our prototype consisted of a USB-type C on a lanyard that authenticated the employee’s fingerprint and controlled access based on the employee’s job description."
Airline Database,Relational Database Management,- Autumn 2017,"In my Relational Database Management class, my group of 4 created a database for an airline. We started with creating an ERD with accurate entities and cardinalities. We created tables for the airline ticket, booking details, airport information, client details along with employee information. We also wrote business rules, created stored procedures, and sub queries for the database. We extracted data from another database to fill out tables in the database and write queries."

We also wrote business rules, created stored procedures, and sub queries for the database. We extracted data from another database to fill out tables in the database and write queries."
